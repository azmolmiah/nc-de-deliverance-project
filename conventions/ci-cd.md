## Overview

### Version Control:
Make sure we're all on the same page with version control. We'll use Git and GitHub for this. We'll create a repository to store our project code and collaborate effectively. Each of us will work on feature branches for each new taks and merge changes to the main branch via pull requests this is also called lean branching. For more information checkout [pull requests](pull-requests.md)

### Write Tests:
We need to ensure the reliability and quality of our codebase. Let's write comprehensive unit tests using pytest or unittest for our Python applications. Additionally, we should include integration tests to validate interactions between different components. Don't forget about security tests using tools like `safety` and `bandit` to scan for vulnerabilities. For more information checkout [pull requests](testing.md)

### Automate Testing with CI (GitHub Actions):
To automate our testing process, we'll set up continuous integration (CI) using GitHub Actions. We'll create workflows that define the steps to run tests whenever we push changes to our repository. This ensures that our codebase remains healthy and functional. We'll also configure GitHub notifications to alert us of CI workflow results. For details on this checkout [github actions](../.github/workflows/actions.yml)

### Continuous Deployment (CD):
With CI in place, let's focus on continuous deployment (CD). We'll configure our CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes to our AWS environment. This includes deploying Python applications to Lambda, updating infrastructure using Terraform, and ensuring proper error handling and rollback mechanisms. or details on this checkout [terrraform](terraform.md)

### Implement Monitoring and Alerting:
Monitoring and alerting are crucial for CI/CD and because we'll be using Github, this will be done for us based on our repository settings.

### Document and Collaborate:
As we proceed, let's document our CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure setup. This ensures that all team members have a clear understanding of how everything works. We'll collaborate closely, sharing knowledge and supporting each other throughout the process using Github projects and repository issues tracker.

### Review and Iterate:
Finally, let's continuously review and iterate on our CI/CD pipeline. We'll conduct regular retrospectives to identify areas for improvement and optimize our process further. Our goal is to deliver a robust and efficient data engineering solution.

This overview should explain how we'll successfully implement CI/CD for our project, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of changes to our AWS environment. With GitHub Actions and notifications in place, we'll stay informed and responsive to any changes or issues in our workflow.
